Resolving this challenge

Some Considerations:
- I tried to focus on keeping a clean architecture and scalability
- Use compose to UI ( I know could be better design, but with usually I use the designer template)
- I only added tests to the discount factory because I think it is one of the more important features of this app and also I can show that I know how to make tests without making it for every single class (which is the best practice in a production app)
